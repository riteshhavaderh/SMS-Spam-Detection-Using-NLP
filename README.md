#  SMS Spam Detection using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

##  DESCRIPTION
This project implements an end-to-end **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** solution to classify SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)**.  
It demonstrates how raw text data can be cleaned, transformed into numerical features using **TF-IDF**, and classified using a **Naive Bayes** machine learning model.
